# **Statistical Methods of Political Science**

This repository contains materials and code for the **Statistical Methods of Political Science** course. The course focuses on applying statistical and computational techniques to analyze political data, covering topics such as data collection, visualization, modeling, and machine learning.

## **Lesson 1: Web Scraping**
The first lesson introduces **web scraping**, a method for collecting data from websites. We use `R` and the libraries `rvest` and `polite` to extract structured information from web pages. The lesson covers:
- Basics of HTML structure and CSS selectors.
- Fetching data using polite requests to avoid blocking.
- Extracting news articles from government websites.
- Handling and storing scraped data in structured formats (CSV, DataFrame).

### **Files in this repository**
- `web_scraping.R` â€“ R script for extracting press releases.
- `scraped_news.csv` â€“ Sample dataset of collected articles.
- `README.md` â€“ Overview of the course and lesson materials.

Stay tuned for future lessons on data analysis, regression models, and machine learning in political science! ðŸš€
